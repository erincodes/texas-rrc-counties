# texas-rrc-counties
An object of arrays mapping which counties in Texas make up each railroad commission RRC district. Refer to Texas RRC source information here: https://www.rrc.state.tx.us/about-us/organization-activities/rrc-locations/counties-by-dist/. This was tedious to create, so I hope it's helpful to others looking for this information in the future!
